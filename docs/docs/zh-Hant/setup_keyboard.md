    * *Allow full access* : We understand you may have concerns about privacy, so we want to reassure you: while enabling Allow Full Access can technically allow a keyboard to send what you type over the internet, WizBoard DOES NOT record keystrokes or store your data anywhere. You data is only sent to be processed by the AI, and only when you ask for it.
Your privacy is paramount to us, and we've designed WizBoard with a strong commitment to protecting it. Please also check our Privacy Policy : http://wizboard.github.io/privacy
