# Why Not Free

Thank you for downloading WizBoard! We're thrilled to have you on board and would like to take this moment to explain why we take a fee for our app.  

The OpenAl API, which powers WizBoard, is a sophisticated tool that enables us to offer a top-notch experience. Unfortunately, it comes at a cost, which we must pass on to our users through a fee for the app. Every request made to the OpenAl API incurs a small charge, which we must pay.  

Additionally, we are dedicated to constantly improving and updating WizBoard to keep it relevant and useful to our users. This requires ongoing investment and development, which is funded by the fees we charge.  

We understand that paying for an app may not be ideal for everyone, but we believe the value WizBoard provides justifies the cost. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.  

Once again, thank you for choosing WizBoard.
