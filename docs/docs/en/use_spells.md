# Use Spells

Spells offer specialized magic tailored to each of your needs. They're accessible both within the main WizBoard application and its associated keyboard.

* **Main App**
    * In the *Gallery* section, search for your preferred spells and add them to the *Spells* tab by tapping on the "+" icon of each spell.
    * Within the *Spells* tab, select a spell to engage and interact, discovering its magic as you pose questions.

* **Keyboard**
    * Wherever you're inputting text via a keyboard (like in messaging apps, emails, notes, etc.), press and hold the globe symbol and choose WizBoard. If it's not visible, kindly consult the [setup guide](setup_keyboard) for keyboard configuration.
    * In the keyboard's *Spells* section, you'll see all the personalized spells.
    * Choose a spell and click the magic wand icon in the top right. The current content in the input field will serve as the input for the spell. Beneath the spell title, you'll find:
        * (Optional) Further spell customizations (like setting a target language for translation).
        * Options for displaying the spell's results:
            * *None*: Displays the spell result within the keyboard frame.
            * *Rewrite*: Replaces content in the input field with the spell result.
            * *Append*: Adds the spell result to the existing content in the input field.
