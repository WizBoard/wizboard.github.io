Note that **Allow Full Access** is required by iOS to let our keyboard access the AI services. WizBoard DOES NOT record keystrokes or store your data anywhere. You data is only sent to be processed by the AI system, and only when you ask for it. Remember, dear wizard, that your journey is uniquely yours.
If you have more concerns about it,  please check our Privacy Policy: http://wizboard.github.io/privacy
* Choose **WizBoard** as your keyboard
