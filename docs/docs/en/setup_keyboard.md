Note that **Allow Full Access** is required by iOS to let our keyboard access the AI services. WizBoard DOES NOT record keystrokes or store your data anywhere. You data is only sent to be processed by the AI system.
If you have more concerns about it,  please check our [Privacy Policy](http://wizboard.github.io/privacy)
* Choose **WizBoard** as your keyboard, now you can use WizBoard now.
