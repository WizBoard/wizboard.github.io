# Edit Spells

To refine your spells further, take advantage of the *edit* feature. In the WizBoard main app's *Spells* tab, press and hold the desired spell, then select the *Edit* option. This allows you to:

* Rename the spell
* Modify the spell's prompt
* Alter the display color associated with the spell
* Dive into advanced edits:
    * Activate chat context for a more conversational spell experience
    * Adjust or add parameters within the spell
    * Offer examples to clarify your spell's purpose (leveraging one-shot/few-shot learning techniques)

Once you've tweaked the settings, click *Try Spell* to engage with your modified spell. Don't forget to save your changes!
